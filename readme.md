### Title 

Issues in developing multivariable molecular signatures for guiding clinical care decisions

### Abstract

Omics technologies that generate a large amount of molecular data
characterizing biospecimens have the potential to provide information
about patients' disease characteristics beyond standard clinical
features. By combining information from a large number of features into
a multivariable model, called a biomarker signature, there is the
opportunity to identify distinct subgroups of patients for whom
treatment decisions can be personalized. The key challenge is to derive
a signature with good performance and appropriately characterize its
performance. We summarize the key statistical issues and methods for
developing and validating biomarker signatures, using examples from the
literature for illustration.
